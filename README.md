DHMathematicsGame
=================

This is simple game based upon basic rules in Mathematics.

This is an implementation of simple trick game using Objective-C and Cocoa framework. 
It is basically user guess game and based on the pre determined mathematical rule, application tries to predict the number recognized by user.

I have Utilized Collection view and native Animation Framework APIs, Storyboard and Standard View Controller lifecycle methods

Here are some of the most exciting screenshots of this game,
